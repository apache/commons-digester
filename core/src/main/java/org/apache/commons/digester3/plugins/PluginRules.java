/**
 * A custom digester Rules manager which must be used as the Rules object when using the plugins module functionality.
 * <p>
 * During parsing, a linked list of PluginCreateRule instances develop, and this list also acts like a stack. The
 * original instance that was set before the Digester started parsing is always at the tail of the list, and the
 * Digester always holds a reference to the instance at the head of the list in the rules member. Initially, this
 * list/stack holds just one instance, ie head and tail are the same object.
 * <p>
 * When the start of an xml element causes a PluginCreateRule to fire, a new PluginRules instance is created and
 * inserted at the head of the list (ie pushed onto the stack of Rules objects). Digester.getRules() therefore returns
 * this new Rules object, and any custom rules associated with that plugin are added to that instance.
 * <p>
 * When the end of the xml element is encountered (and therefore the PluginCreateRule end method fires), the stack of
 * Rules objects is popped, so that Digester.getRules returns the previous Rules object.
 * 
 * @since 1.6
